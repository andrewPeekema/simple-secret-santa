# 🎅 Simple Secret Santa

People picking through practically private pairings

**Try it here:** https://andrewpeekema.github.io/simple-secret-santa/

How it works:
1. Generate pairings by entering participant names
2. Share each link privately with the right person
3. Each person sees their assignment and gets a wishlist password
4. Wishlists are optional — if shared, only the right Santa can unlock them
